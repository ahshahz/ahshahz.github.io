        		<h1>Projects</h1>
				<p> Why the lack of projects ? </p>
				<p> I formerly had a pre-med concentration. I decided to drop it as I enjoy coding a lot more </p>
                <p> I only had time to work on academic projects (homework). </p>
                <p> If I have applied to you're job or your interested in hiring me. I will provide an additional sample of my academic work. Just contact me! </p>
                <p>	My email is in the footer </p> 			
				<h2> Sorting Visualizer </h2> 
				<p> Basic UI for the program </p>
				<img src="/projects/images/UI.JPG"></img>
				<p> How to use </p>
                <p> The project is on Github. So just download the project and open in IDE of choice </p>
				<p> This project was coded in Java and IntelliJ was used </p>
				<p> Description and Goal </p>
		        <p> The goals for this project were to enhance skills in Java, learn and implement sorting algorithms, and utilize Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern as much as possible</p> 
				<p> This program is meant to demonstrate a visual representation of numbers as color.</p>
			    <p> That way we could see a 2D array (Data structure) as a visual. </p>
                <p> So each pixel represents a number inside the 2d array </p>  
				<p> So then we can see how well the sorting algorithm perform and how accurately the array is sorted </p>
				<p> The program has a user menu and uses insertion sort or quicksort depending on user input </p>
				<p> Each number is represented with a color. That color depends on a range: </p>
				<p> Intense red represents numbers <= -255 </p>
				<p> Red to black represents numbers <= -1 </p>
				<p> numbers that are 0 are shown as black </p>
				<p> The numbers from 1 to 255 are shown as the color increases in intensity from black to green </p>
				<p> The numbers from 256 and above are represented with the color green </p> 
				<p> The next few lines will demonstrate how the program works </p>
				<p> The array is initialized to random values </p>

		        <p> Result when quicksort is used </p>

				<p> Credits </p>
				<p> C343 Instructor and Teacher assistants </p>
				<p> Thanks to Leepoint. The information for MVC was invaluable <a href="https://www.leepoint.net/GUI/structure/40mvc.html">click here</a>. </p>
				<p> Thanks to GeekforGeeks for help with Quicksort algorithm </p>
				<h3> Stratego AI </h3>
				<p> Python was used and PyCharm </p> 
				<p> Description and Goal </p>
				<p> The goal of this project was to make a Stratego AI. The AI could play against a player </p>
				<p> This project was a group project with two other individuals. They contributed substantially to the project as well.</p>
				<p> For a description about Stratego and how to play please  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego">Click Here</a> </p>
				<p> The AI would win 80% of the time </p>
                <p> Here is an example where the AI won against a randomized ai </p>

				<h4> Future Projects</h4>
				<p> Sudoku board with an AI solver </p>
